*rqlite* combines SQLite's simplicity with the power of a robust, fault-tolerant distributed database. It's designed for easy deployment and efficient operation, offering a developer-friendly and operation-centric solution across [Linux, macOS, Windows, and on various CPU platforms](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases).

## Why run rqlite?
rqlite is your solution for a [rock-solid](https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html), fault-tolerant, relational database with **effortless installation, deployment, and operation**. It's ideal as a lightweight, distributed relational data store for both developers and operators. Think [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) or [etcd](https://etcd.io/), but with relational modeling available.

You can use rqlite for critical relational data in larger systems. And if you're interested in understanding how distributed systems actually work, it's a good example to study. A lot of thought has gone into its [design](https://rqlite.io/docs/design/), separating storage, consensus, and API clearly.

### Key features
- **Easy Deployment**: Up and running in seconds, with no separate SQLite installation.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Straightforward [HTTP API](https://rqlite.io/docs/api/), [CLI](https://rqlite.io/docs/cli/), and [client libraries](https://rqlite.io/docs/api/client-libraries/).
- **Fully Replicated**: SQL database with [full-text search](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html) and [JSON support](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html).
- **Dynamic Clustering**: Integrates with Kubernetes, Consul, etcd, and DNS for [automatic clustering](https://rqlite.io/docs/clustering/automatic-clustering/).
- **Robust Security**: [Extensive encryption and TLS support](https://rqlite.io/docs/guides/security/).
- **Flexible Consistency**: Customize [read/write performance](https://rqlite.io/docs/api/read-consistency/) and [durability](https://rqlite.io/docs/api/queued-writes/).
- **Scalable Reads**: [Read-only nodes](https://rqlite.io/docs/clustering/read-only-nodes/) for enhanced scalability.
- **Transactions**: Supports a form of transactions.
- **Easy Backups**: Hot [backups](https://rqlite.io/docs/guides/backup/), including [automatic backups to AWS S3](https://rqlite.io/docs/guides/backup/#automatic-backups), as well as [restore directly from SQLite](https://rqlite.io/docs/guides/backup/#restoring-from-sqlite).
