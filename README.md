[**rqlite**](https://rqlite.io) is a [rock](https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html)-[solid](https://philipotoole.com/how-is-rqlite-tested/), highly-available, distributed relational database built on [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). It's lightweight, developer-friendly, and exceptionally easy to operate.

Use rqlite to reliably store your most important data, ensuring it's always available to your applications -- think [etcd](https://etcd.io/), but with relational modeling available. Whether you're deploying **resilient services in the cloud** or **reliable applications at the edge**, rqlite is a solution that offers effortless installation, deployment, and operation.

## Quick Start
[_Check out the full Quick Start guide_](https://rqlite.io/docs/quick-start/)

**1. Run a rqlite node:**
```bash
docker run -p 4001:4001 rqlite/rqlite
```

**2. Create a table and insert a row:**
```bash
curl -XPOST 'localhost:4001/db/execute?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[
     "CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)",
     "INSERT INTO foo(id, name) VALUES(1, \"fiona\")"
]'
```

**3. Query the data:**
```bash
curl -G 'localhost:4001/db/query?pretty' --data-urlencode 'q=SELECT * FROM foo'
