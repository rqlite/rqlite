# Backups

rqlite supports hot backing up a node. You can retrieve and write a consistent copy of the underlying SQLite database to a file via the CLI:
```
127.0.0.1:4001> .backup bak.sqlite3
backup file written successfully
```
This command will write the SQLite database file to `bak.sqlite3`.

You can also access the rqlite API directly, via a HTTP `GET` request to the endpoint `/db/backup`. For example, using `curl`, and assuming the node is listening on `localhost:4001`, you could retrieve a backup as follows:
```bash
curl -s -XGET localhost:4001/db/backup -o bak.sqlite3
```

In either case the generated file file can then be used to restore a node (or cluster) using the [restore API](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/RESTORE_FROM_SQLITE.md).

## SQL dumps
You can also dump the database in a SQL text format via the API as follows:
```
bash
curl -s -XGET localhost:4001/db/backup?fmt=sql -o bak.sql
```
