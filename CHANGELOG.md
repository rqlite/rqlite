## 6.6.3 (October 20th 2021)
This release is the first to statically link `libc` for the Linux version of rqlite. While this does increase the size of binary, one of the main goals of rqlite is ease of deployment. With fully static linking, official releases will run on an even wider range of distributions.

### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #911](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/911): Statically link all requirements, including `libc`, for rqlite on Linux. macOS retains dynamically linking.

## 6.3.0 (August 28th 2021)
This release introduces transparent request forwarding, which simplifies interacting with rqlite clusters. Client requests that must be served by the leader will no longer return HTTP 301, and will be forwarded transparently to the leader if necessary. Client software does not need to change to take advantage of this new functionality.

Systems running earlier 6.x software can be upgraded to this release without doing any special, but all nodes in the new cluster must be running this release. This release cannot communicate with nodes running earlier 6.x software.

- [PR #846](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/846): New DB and FSM indexes to track state.

## 6.0.1 (June 28th 2021)
### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #822](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/822): Don't ignore `-join` even if previous state exists. Fixes [issue #818](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/818).

## 6.0.0 (June 8th 2021)
This release implements a significant design change, which improves rqlite cluster reliability. With this change a rqlite node can more reliably direct read and write requests to the correct node.

In the 5.0 series, _Follower_ nodes learned the HTTP API address of the cluster Leader via information - known as _Metadata_ - that each node wrote to the Raft log. This Metadata was then available to each node in the cluster, if that node needed to redirect queries to the cluster Leader (assuming that node wasn't the Leader at that time). However that design was somewhat complex, and required the tracking of extra state, in addition to the SQLite database. It also meant that if the Metadata got out of sync with the Raft state, the cluster could be in a degraded state.

In this new design, a node now queries the Leader as needed, when that node needs to learn the Leader's HTTP API address. As a result, the Metadata component has been removed from rqlite, since it is no longer needed. And without any possibility of discrepancy between Metadata and Raft state, a whole class of potential bugs is removed. Any request for the Leader HTTP API address means the requesting node node connects to a TCP port already open on the Leader for Raft connections, so does not introduce any new failure modes. This multiplexing of the Raft TCP port is performed via the `mux` package.

This new design does mean that nodes running earlier software cannot communicate with 6.0 nodes, as 6.0 software no longer performs Metadata updates. As a result, **rqlite clusters running 5.x software or earlier must be explicitly upgraded**. To upgrade from an earlier version to this release you should [backup your Leader node](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/BACKUPS.md), and [restore the database dump](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/RESTORE_FROM_SQLITE.md) into a new 6.0 cluster.

The data API and cluster-management API remain unchanged however, so client code that communicates with rqlite should not need any changes.

### New features
- [PR #796](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/796): `nodes/` API reports real-time status of other nodes in cluster. Fixes [issue #768](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/768).

- [PR #620](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/620): Log level can be specified for Raft module.

## 5.0.0 (December 30th 2019)
This release uses a new Raft consensus version, with the move to Hashicorp Raft v1. As a result **the Raft system in 5.0 is not compatible with the 4.0 series**. To upgrade from an earlier version to this release you should backup your 4.0 leader node, and restore the database dump into a new 5.0 cluster.

The rqlite server also supports explicitly setting the node ID. While it's not required to set this, it's recommended for production clusters. See the [cluster documentation](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/CLUSTER_MGMT.md) for more details.

The HTTP Query and Insert API remains unchanged in the 5.0 series relative to the 4.0 series.
