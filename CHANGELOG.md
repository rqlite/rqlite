## 8.12.0 (December 17th 2023)
This version sees the minor version incremented to indicate the importance of this release. Bcrypted passwords were not secure in the Credentials Configuration, as they could also be used directly as passwords. This has been fixed, and bcrypted passwords are no longer supported going forward. **All users using bcrypted hashes in Credential files should upgrade to this release** and migrate to using plaintext passwords in those files.

If you were using bcrypted passwords, **this is probably a breaking change**. You should recreate any Credentials Configuration files to use plaintext passwords instead of bcrypt hashes, and ensure the Credentials Configuration files are secured from unauthorized access.

## 8.0.1 (December 8th 2023)
This release fixes an edge case issue during restore-from-SQLite. It's possible if a rqlite system crashes shortly after restoring from SQLite it may not have loaded the data correctly.

### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #1456](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1456): Wrap Snaphot Store _FullNeeded_ logic in a function.
- [PR #1457](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1457): Allow FullNeeded to be explicity set to true.
- [PR #1458](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1458): Perform full snapshot after chunked load.

## 8.0.0 (December 5th 2023)
This release introduces support for much larger data sets. Previously the [Raft snapshotting](https://raft.github.io/) process became more memory intensive and time-consuming as the SQLite database became larger. This set an practical upper limit on the size of the SQLite database. With the 8.0 release rqlite has been fundamentally redesigned such that snapshotting consumes approximately the same amount of resources, regardless of the size of the SQLite database.

This release also eases operations, as well as adding new features and bug fixes.

### Upgrading from the 7.x release

Release 8.0 supports (mostly) seamless upgrades from the 7.x series, and upgrading from 7.x has been tested. However, it is still strongly recommended you backup any production cluster before attempting an upgrade. A more conservative approach would be to create a brand new 8.0 system, and load your backup into that cluster. Then switch production traffic over to the new 8.0 cluster.

8.0 and 7.x nodes should be able to interoperate, so a rolling upgrade should work fine **as long as all nodes are fully caught up with the Leader node**. Note you also cannot join a new 8.x node to a pre-existing 7.x cluster. Otherwise upgrade should operate but, again, it is strongly recommended you test this first. It is also not recommended that you run a cluster with a mix of 7.x and 8.0 code for any significant length of time, just the time required for a rolling upgrade.

Important things to note if you decide to upgrade an existing 7.x system:
- Backup your 7.x cluster first.
- it is strongly recommended you upgrade your 7.x cluster to the [7.21.4](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases/tag/v7.21.4) release before upgrading to the 8.0 series.
- 8.0 always runs with an on-disk database, in-memory databases are no longer supported. Improvements made late in the 7.0 series mean there is little difference in write performance between in-memory and on-disk modes, but supporting both modes just meant confusion and higher development costs. If you were previously running in in-memory mode (the previous default), you don't need to do anything. But if you were previously passing `-on-disk` to `rqlited` so that rqlite ran in on-disk mode, you must now remove that flag.
- When forming a new cluster using 8.0, pass the **Raft** addresss of the remote node to the `-join` command, not the HTTP API address. If your cluster is already formed, upgrades will work without changing anything (`-join` options are ignored if nodes are already members of a cluster). You may need to change any scripting or automatic-configuration generation however.
- Bcrypted password hashes are no longer supported, due to security flaws in the 7.x release. You should regenerate any [Credentials file](https://rqlite.io/docs/guides/security/), and use plaintext passwords only (and prevent unauthorized access to the Credentials file).
- A few rarely, if ever, used `rqlited` command-line flags have been removed. These flags just added operational overhead, while adding little value.

- [PR #1325](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1325): Handle getting an error when asking for database stats.

## 7.21.1 (June 26th 2023)
This release changes the mode of SQLite, when rqlite is running in _on-disk_ mode. SQLite now runs in WAL mode, when previously it was in DELETE mode. Testing shows this results in a ~30% increase in write-performance.

### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #1314](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1314): More preparations for WAL mode when running on-disk.
- [PR #1315](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1315), [PR #1316](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1316): Enable WAL when running in on-disk mode.

- [PR #1303](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1303): Reduce disk space usage by retaining only a single Raft SQLite snapshot.

## 7.20.4 (June 13th 2023)
This release changes the "syncing" mode SQLite uses to _OFF_ when rqlite runs in "on-disk" mode. The [SQLite docs](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous) state that this risks database corruption in the event of a crash, but that's a non-issue for rqlite, as rqlite always deletes any SQLite database on startup and rebuilds it from the Raft log. Testing shows this change results in (at least) a 3x speed-up in write performance when operating in "on-disk" mode.

### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #1301](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1301): Set synchronous mode to `OFF` for SQLite on-disk files.

- [PR #1296](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1296): Use correct connection when checking a SQL statement for "read-only" status, otherwise "database locked" could result. Also refactors much of the DB-level unit tests.

## 7.20.1 (June 1st 2023)
### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #1291](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1291): Allow bootstrap-join even with preexisting state. Fixes [issue #1290](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/1290)

## 7.18.0 (May 18th 2023)
This release adds a new HTTP endpoint, located at `/db/request`. This endpoint accepts both read and write requests, including mixing both together in a single request. When requests are sent to this endpoint, rqlite will automatically perform the correct operation for each SQL statement in the request. This endpoint may be more convenient for some use cases, and means that client code doesn't have to decide on whether it should send requests to `/db/execute` or `/db/query`. Many thanks to [VOXO](https://voxo.co/) for funding this development.

7.18.0 also includes some small improvements to [diagnostics and instrumentation](https://rqlite.io/docs/guides/monitoring-rqlite/).

For this to work however, all nodes in your cluster must be running 7.8.0 (or later). Otherwse 7.8.0 is fully compatible with earlier release, so a rolling upgrade process is an option.

### New features
- [PR #1081](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1081): Transparently forward Backup requests to Leaders.

### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #1079](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1079): Use a Protobuf model for Backup requests.

See the [documentation](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/QUEUED_WRITES.md) for full details.

### New features
- [PR #1019](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1019): CLI supports restoring from SQLite database files.
- [PR #1024](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1024), [PR #1025](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1025), [PR #1031](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1031), [PR #1033](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1033): Add support for Queued Writes.

### New features
- [PR #1017](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1017), [PR #1018](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1018): Support restoring from SQLite data files. Fixes [issue #1005](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/1016).
### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #1015](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/1015): go mod (dependencies) updates.

## 7.3.2 (March 1st 2022)
### Implementation changes and bug fixes

## 7.3.1 (February 6th 2022)
Fixes an issue in the 7.3.0 release that prevented clusters, which used TLS for internode communications, from operating correctly. All deployments using TLS should be upgraded to this version.
### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #998](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/998): Node TLS mux needs to use advertised Raft address. Thanks to [Nathan Ferch](https://github.com/nferch) for the bug report.

## 7.3.0 (February 5th 2022)
With this release rqlite networking is based on whatever network identifiers are passed in at launch. If hostnames are passed they are no longer resolved into IP addresses internally by rqlite, and only the low-level networking layers will do so. This allows rqlite to operate correctly even when cluster node IP addresses change, as long as the hostnames remain the same. This is common in deployment environments such as Kubernetes, particularly when using [StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).

Upgrading an earlier cluster to this release is possible, simply by explicitly setting the IP address of each node at the command line. Alternatively, simply [backup your previous node](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/BACKUPS.md) and [restore it](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/RESTORE_FROM_SQLITE.md) into a new 7.3.0 node. **In any event, backing up your data is always recommended before any upgrade takes place.**

### New features
- [PR #993](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/993): Support IP addresses changing by not explicitly resolving network addresses. Fixes [issue #695](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/695), [issue #774](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/744), and [issue #991](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/991). Thanks to @git001 for help testing this change. 

## 7.2.0 (February 1st 2022)
This release introduces supported for [DNS-based](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) and [DNS SRV -based](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-srv-record/) autoclustering. rqlite can now lookup a DNS record for specified host, and use the network addresses returned to bootstrap the cluster. This can make it much easier to create rqlite clusters using the kinds of Service-Discovery mechanisms you find on Consul and Kubernetes, which are often based on DNS. See the [documentation](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/AUTO_CLUSTERING.md) for full details on using DNS-based autoclustering.

### New features
- [PR #979](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/979): Add support for DNS-based autoclustering. Fixes [issue #554](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/554)
- [PR #985](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/985): Add support for DNS SRV -based autoclustering. Fixes [issue #554](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/554)

### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #976](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/976): Improve `/readyz` response.
- [PR #978](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/978): Return error on join request if node ID is the same as receiving node.
- [PR #980](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/980): Move config validation to Config type.
- [PR #981](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/981): Add curent time to node `/status` output.
- [PR #982](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/982): `/readyz` can skip leader check via `noleader` query param.
- [PR #984](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/984): Count number of `/status` and `/readyz` requests via expvar.
- [PR #986](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/986): Refactor join code with new Joiner type.
- [PR #987](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/987): Upgrade to SQLite 3.37.0.

## 7.1.0 (January 28th 2022)
This release introduces a new automatic clustering approach, known as _Bootstrapping_, which allows rqlite clusters to form without assistance from an external system such as Consul. This can be very useful for certain deployment scenarios. See the [documentation](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/AUTO_CLUSTERING.md) for full details on using the new Bootstrapping mode. Special thanks to [Nathan Ferch](https://github.com/nferch) for his advice regarding the design and development of this feature.

### New features
- [PR #974](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/974): Add support for automatically bootstrapping clusters from just rqlite nodes.

## 7.0.1 (January 26th 2022)
### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #957](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/971): Correct rqlite command line options in log message.
- [PR #973](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/973): Use correct JSON field name for Consul disco scheme

## 7.0.0 (January 25th 2022)
This release introduces new node-discovery integration with [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) and [etcd](https://etcd.io/). By using one of those systems with rqlite, automatic clustering of rqlite is much easier. The [legacy Discovery mode](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/DISCOVERY.md) is not supported by release 7.0, but may be supported in a future release. So, for now, if you wish to continue using legacy Discovery, you will need to run rqlite 6.x, or earlier.

See the [new documentation](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/AUTO_CLUSTERING.md) for full details on using Consul and etcd.

### Upgrading
This release uses a new database for the Raft system, which should be compatible with earlier releases. However it is strongly recommended you [backup any existing Leader nodes](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/BACKUPS.md) before you run 7.0, in the event there are any issues.

There are also some breaking changes in release 7.0, related to command-line arguments:
- The disco-related command-line arguments have changed to support Consul and etcd. If you wish to continue to use legacy Discovery, you can't upgrade to 7.0 -- or consider using Consul or etcd for node-discovery.
- The command-line argument `-RaftWaitForLeader` has been removed. If you need to wait for a node to have a Leader, you should poll the `/readyz` endpoint.

### New features
- [PR #957](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/957): Support autoclustering via use [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) and [etcd](https://etcd.io/) KV stores.
- [PR #947](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/947): CLI takes list of hosts, so it can try another node if first node is unresponsive. Fixes [issue #157](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/157). Thanks @chermehdi

## 6.0.1 (June 28th 2021)
### Implementation changes and bug fixes
- [PR #822](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/822): Don't ignore `-join` even if previous state exists. Fixes [issue #818](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/818).

## 6.0.0 (June 8th 2021)
This release implements a significant design change, which improves rqlite cluster reliability. With this change a rqlite node can more reliably direct read and write requests to the correct node.

In the 5.0 series, _Follower_ nodes learned the HTTP API address of the cluster Leader via information - known as _Metadata_ - that each node wrote to the Raft log. This Metadata was then available to each node in the cluster, if that node needed to redirect queries to the cluster Leader (assuming that node wasn't the Leader at that time). However that design was somewhat complex, and required the tracking of extra state, in addition to the SQLite database. It also meant that if the Metadata got out of sync with the Raft state, the cluster could be in a degraded state.

In this new design, a node now queries the Leader as needed, when that node needs to learn the Leader's HTTP API address. As a result, the Metadata component has been removed from rqlite, since it is no longer needed. And without any possibility of discrepancy between Metadata and Raft state, a whole class of potential bugs is removed. Any request for the Leader HTTP API address means the requesting node node connects to a TCP port already open on the Leader for Raft connections, so does not introduce any new failure modes. This multiplexing of the Raft TCP port is performed via the `mux` package.

This new design does mean that nodes running earlier software cannot communicate with 6.0 nodes, as 6.0 software no longer performs Metadata updates. As a result, **rqlite clusters running 5.x software or earlier must be explicitly upgraded**. To upgrade from an earlier version to this release you should [backup your Leader node](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/BACKUPS.md), and [restore the database dump](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/RESTORE_FROM_SQLITE.md) into a new 6.0 cluster.

The data API and cluster-management API remain unchanged however, so client code that communicates with rqlite should not need any changes.

### New features
- [PR #796](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/796): `nodes/` API reports real-time status of other nodes in cluster. Fixes [issue #768](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/issues/768).

- [PR #620](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/pull/620): Log level can be specified for Raft module.

## 5.0.0 (December 30th 2019)
This release uses a new Raft consensus version, with the move to Hashicorp Raft v1. As a result **the Raft system in 5.0 is not compatible with the 4.0 series**. To upgrade from an earlier version to this release you should backup your 4.0 leader node, and restore the database dump into a new 5.0 cluster.

The rqlite server also supports explicitly setting the node ID. While it's not required to set this, it's recommended for production clusters. See the [cluster documentation](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/CLUSTER_MGMT.md) for more details.

The HTTP Query and Insert API remains unchanged in the 5.0 series relative to the 4.0 series.
