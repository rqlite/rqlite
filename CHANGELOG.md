## 4.0.0 (unreleased)
**The 4.0 release has renamed command-line options relative to earlier releases.** This means that previous commands used to launch rqlited will not work. However the command-line changes are cosmetic, and each previous option maps 1-to-1 to a renamed option. Otherwise deployments of earlier releases can be upgraded to the 4.0 series without any other work.
