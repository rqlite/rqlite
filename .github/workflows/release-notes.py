_rqlite_ is a lightweight, distributed relational database, which uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as its storage engine. rqlite provides an easy-to-use, fault-tolerant store for your most important relational data. You can learn a lot more about rqlite at [rqlite.io](https://www.rqlite.io).

See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for full details on {release}, and check out the _Assets_ section below for prebuilt binaries.

## Getting started
_Check out the [Quick Start guide](https://rqlite.io/docs/quick-start/)._

To download and run a single rqlite node follow the directions below. It's also very easy to run a rqlite cluster -- you can learn more by checking out the [documentation](https://rqlite.io/docs/clustering/).

If you wish to build rqlite from source, check out [this documentation](https://rqlite.io/docs/install-rqlite/building-from-source/).

### Docker
Run a single node as follows:
```
docker pull rqlite/rqlite
docker run -p4001:4001 rqlite/rqlite
```

Check out the [rqlite Docker page](https://hub.docker.com/r/rqlite/rqlite/) for more details on running nodes via Docker.

### Linux
_Builds for a variety of CPU architectures are available. See the Assets section below._

You need to choose the correct build for your CPU and Linux distribution. For most systems the `amd64` build is the one to use, but distributions such as Alpine may need to run the `musl` release.

To download and start rqlite for `amd64`, execute the following in a shell. 
```
curl -L https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases/download/v8.26.6/rqlite-v8.26.6-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o rqlite-v8.26.6-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz rqlite-v8.26.6-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd rqlite-v8.26.6-linux-amd64
./rqlited ~/node.1
```

### macOS
Install via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/rqlite).

```brew install rqlite```

### Windows
rqlite can be built for Windows, and Windows compatibility is ensured via [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/). You can download a pre-built release for Windows in one of two ways:
- The top-of-tree build [is available for download](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/otoolep/rqlite/artifacts/rqlite-latest-win64.zip?branch=master) from AppVeyor. Check out the [CI build for Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/otoolep/rqlite) for more details.
- Download the Win64 [build artifact attached to this release](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases/download/{release}/rqlite-{release}-win64.zip). This build is currently considered experimental.
